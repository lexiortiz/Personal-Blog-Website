                <p class="post-desc-1">I began the challenge by building out a digital wireframe of my portfolio and labeling elements with semantic HTML, IDs, and classes. This will make it easier and quicker for me when I am ready to code. After labeling, I worked on the CSS Grid lesson in the classroom and practiced building Grid layouts in Codepen.</p>
                <h3 class="post-desc-title-2">Tomorrow...</h3>
                <p class="post-desc-2">I will begin coding my portfolio website's HTML with the help of my labeled wireframe. Afterwards, I hope to put to practice what I am learning about CSS Flexbox and Grid with a mini project before I move on to the next lesson in the classroom.</p>
